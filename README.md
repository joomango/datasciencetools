# datasciencetools

The datasciencetools module includes a collection of tools I've developed to make doing and visualizing data science results easier and more beautiful. This project was started during my time at Insight Data Science, and includes tools I built during my Insight project, as well as during secondary projects and data challenges. You can find good use cases of the datasciencetoolbox in two projects listed on my github account:

> **My Insight project (predicting Parkinson's from mobile app data):**

> https://github.com/mattoby/mpower_memory

> **A project predicting blood lead levels in Michigan:**

> https://github.com/mattoby/michigan_lead

I have included here an ipython notebook that gives use cases of the datasciencetoolbox, in the page:

To use the datasciencetoolbox, clone this repo to your local machine, and then import the 'datasciencetools.py' module like:

> import datasciencetools as dst

Thanks!
